{"name":"Paul Horner","tagline":"","body":"## About Me\r\n\r\nI am a learning technologist and web developer working within the Faculty of Business and Law at Northumbria University.  I primarily use Django, Python and JQuery, but also have experience of using various other frameworks and languages. I have a passion for innovation, and take great pride in producing simple, easy to use solutions.  I take a keen interest in emerging technologies and use best practice in areas such as version control and documentation.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n\r\n* **MSc Web Information Management**, Northumbria University, 2003-2005\r\n* **BA(Hons) Politics**, Newcastle University, 1997-2000\r\n* **4 A-Levels** - Business Studies (B), History (B), General Studies (B), Maths (D)\r\n* **10 GCSEs Grade A-C**, including Maths and English\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Work Experience\r\n\r\n### Northumbria University\r\n**eLearning Developer**\r\n_February 2012 – present_\r\n \r\n> My key responsibility is the design, development and ongoing maintenance of the [Law School's webcasts system](https://law-webcasts.northumbria.ac.uk).  I have project managed the technical elements of the webcasts system and have worked closely with academic staff to ensure that the technical developments meet the teaching and learning requirements of the faculty. \r\n\r\n> I have been responsible for planning the underlying architecture for the webcasts system, and liaising with key stakeholders to ensure that the technical infrastructure meets the requirements of the faculty.  I was responsible for setting up the software running on the servers and have continued to ensure that everything continues to run smoothly and efficiently.   I have also been involved in the filming and post-production of the webcasts videos, and was responsible for producing the specification for the equipment required in the faculty’s filming suite.\r\n \r\n### Newcastle University\r\n**Internet Developer**\r\n_2005 – 2012_\r\n \r\n> My primary role involved the development of eLearning systems.  Originally my focus was in the field of ePortfolios, but over time I became involved in other areas, including curriculum design and the development of components within the Medical degree programme's virtual learning environment.  I took a lead on the development, delivery and support of eLearning and appraisal systems for postgraduate research students.  I sat on university-wide steering groups, and developed the ePortfolio which was included as part of the Newcastle 'offer' for 2012.  I was successful in bidding for a number of externally funded projects.  \r\n \r\n### Business Link County Durham\r\n**Systems Development Officer**\r\n_2001 - 2005_\r\n \r\n> I was responsible for managing the company-wide Oracle Database, including training and development of staff in using the database client.  I sat on a national user group for the database client.  I developed a number of systems delivered over the company intranet, including a purchasing system, provider management system and Management Information system. I provided IT support services, such as networking, systems security and desktop software support. \r\n \r\n### Employment Service (Now Jobcentre Plus)\r\n**Information Officer**\r\n_2000 - 2001_\r\n\r\n> I was responsible for providing a labour market information service to customers. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## My Skills \r\n\r\nI have been developing **eLearning** systems since 2005 through my work at Northumbria University and previously at Newcastle University.  I have developed diverse systems ranging including **Virtual Learning Environments**, Video Learning Systems, **ePortfolios** and Student Management Systems.  I have delivered presentations on my work at **Conferences** across the UK and Europe, and have subsequently authored a number of published papers. \r\n\r\nI have been using **Python** professionally for many years.  I have extensive experience of **Zope**, and have used **Django** since 2009. I attended the **Djangocon** conference in Portland Oregon in 2009, which provided me with invaluable knowledge that I have been able to apply to my work over the subsequent years.  \r\n\r\nAs a Developer I try to adhere as much as possible to the **DRY** principle and I always try to make my code as reusable as possible, primarily through the use of **object-orientated** code.  I always ensure that my code is appropriately documented, using Sphinx software to publish **documentation**.  As one would expect, I am fully versed in **HTML** and **XHTML** and have used **HTML5** for delivering video content and in the development of **mobile apps**.  \r\n\r\nI ensure that all my sites work on major browsers (from Internet Explorer 7 and above). I am an expert user of **CSS**, and have been responsible for the design elements of a number of websites that I have developed. My Masters degree instilled in me the importance of **usability** in user-interface design. I have read Jakob Nielsen’s work in web usability, and although I sometimes disagree with his ideas I always try to follow the principal that simplicity is best, and firmly believe that usable websites do not have to be uninteresting.\r\n\r\nI am an experienced user of **XML**, and in my time at Newcastle was funded to work alongside commercial providers to develop two separate XML specifications, for e-portfolios and for competency frameworks. I have also developed and written applications to consume XML-based web services, using **REST**, **SOAP** and **XML-RPC**. I have used a number of commercially available APIs, both in my professional work and in personal projects, including applications that consume the **APIs** from Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and Last.fm. \r\n\r\nI use **Javascript** to enhance the user interfaces of the websites I develop, including using **AJAX** (and **JSON** as the data format) to provide more interactive and intuitive methods of communicating with the database. I am a particular advocate of **JQuery**, but have also used several other Javascript frameworks, including Mootools, Prototype and Scriptaculous.  I have used **JQuery mobile** and **Phonegap** in developing mobile apps.  I am a regular user of **GIT** for version control through **[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/paulh)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/paulhorner79/)**, and have also used both SVN and Mercurial.  \r\n\r\nIn my role at Business Link, I was primarily a **PHP** developer, and I have always tried to maintain a good level of knowledge of PHP.  I have investigated the **CakePHP** and **CodeIgniter** frameworks and developed the mapofstrange.com website, which showcased unusual sightings in **Google Maps**. At its peak, this site regularly had more than a million unique visits every month, and was even once featured on German television. \r\n\r\nI am experienced in **server administration**, and am a regular user of the **Linux** command line.  I have setup Linux and **Windows** servers to deploy websites.  I have designed technical architectures to ensure that systems and software work together.  I understand the importance of ensuring that systems are always available and have developed and deployed a monitoring system, which notifies me by email and text message whenever the Northumbria webcasts system is unavailable.\r\n\r\nI have been heavily involved in the **filming** and **production** of professional-level **videos**, using technology from the **Adobe Creative Suite**.  The Law School webcasts system I developed uses a combination of **HTML5** and **Flash** to ensure that the maximum number of people can view the videos.  \r\n\r\nI am an experienced **database administrator**.  I have used **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** widely, and use **MSSQL Server** at Northumbria for enterprise-level systems. I have experience of using **SQLAlchemy** to consume data from legacy systems alongside the **Django ORM**. My Masters degree taught me good data management techniques, including **database normalisation** techniques and indexing.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Further Information\r\n\r\nIf you would like to get in touch with me, send me an email - paulhorner79[at]gmail.com\r\n\r\nFeel free to check me out online -\r\n\r\n* [Law School Webcasts](https://law-webcasts.northumbria.ac.uk)\r\n* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/paulh)\r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/paulhorner79/)\r\n* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulhorner)\r\n* [Last.fm](http://last.fm/user/phorner/)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
