<h3>Durham University</h3>
<p><strong>Information Systems Specialist (Web Services)</strong></p>
<em>February 2014 - Present</em>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a member of the Web Team within the Computing and Information Service at Durham University. My role involves developing web applications for internal customers within the University. </p>
<p>My role primarily uses PHP for server-side development, using tools such as Laravel, Twig, Doctrine and Swiftmailer to enhance the applications I develop. On the client side I use Bootstrap, JQuery and Angular to make attractive and interactive and user interfaces. </p>
<p>I automate much of the scaffolding of the sites I build using tools like Composer, Bower and Grunt to ensure that the latest versions of libraries are used and to avoid dependency issues.</p>
<p>We use Github enterprise to maintain our source code, with deployment handled automatically using Jenkins.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Orchard Information Systems</h3>
<p><strong>Rapid Application Developer</strong></p>
<em>October 2013 – February 2014</em>
<blockquote>
<p>I was a member of the rapid applications development team at Orchard with responsibility for the development of a mobile application to allow social housing tenants to access their account details on mobile devices. This was a browser-based application that used a combination of the Dojo Javascript framework, JSP scripts and JSON. </p>
<p>I used Orchard’s own custom toolkit for developing server-side code. This allowed the applications I developed to interact with the software used by the social housing provider, creating workflows and allowing seamless integration between several applications. This work also involved using SOAP-based web services to pass binary data from mobile devices to the main Orchard Housing application, meaning that tenants could attach photographs to reports of anti-social behaviour or when requesting repairs.</p>

<h3>Northumbria University</h3>

<p><strong>eLearning Developer</strong>
<em>February 2012 – October 2013</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My key responsibility was the design, development and ongoing maintenance of the Law School’s webcasts system (<a href="https://law-webcasts.northumbria.ac.uk">https://law-webcasts.northumbria.ac.uk</a>). I project managed the technical elements of the webcasts system and worked closely with academic staff to ensure that the technical developments met the teaching and learning requirements of the faculty. </p>
<p>I was responsible for planning the underlying architecture for the webcasts system, and liaising with key stakeholders to ensure that the technical infrastructure met the requirements of the faculty. I was responsible for setting up the software running on the servers and continued to ensure that everything ran smoothly and efficiently. I was also involved in the filming and post-production of the webcasts videos, and was responsible for producing the specification for the equipment required in the faculty’s filming suite.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Newcastle University</h3>

<p><strong>Internet Developer</strong>
<em>2005 – 2012</em></p>

<p>My primary role involved the development of eLearning systems.  Originally my focus was in the field of ePortfolios, but over time I became involved in other areas, including curriculum design and the development of components within the Medical degree programme's virtual learning environment.  I took a lead on the development, delivery and support of eLearning and appraisal systems for postgraduate research students.  I sat on university-wide steering groups, and developed the ePortfolio which was included as part of the Newcastle 'offer' for 2012.  I was successful in bidding for a number of externally funded projects.  </p>

<hr><h2>My Skills</h2>

<p>I have been developing <strong>eLearning</strong> systems since 2005 through my work at the Univeristies of Durham, 
  Northumbria, and Newcastle.  I have developed diverse systems ranging including <strong>Virtual Learning Environments</strong>, 
  Video Learning Systems, <strong>ePortfolios</strong> and Student Management Systems.  I have delivered presentations on my work 
  at <strong>Conferences</strong> across the UK and Europe, and have subsequently authored a number of published papers. </p>
<p>I have been using <strong>Python</strong> professionally for many years.  I have extensive experience of 
  <strong>Zope</strong>, and have used <strong>Django</strong> since 2009. I attended the <strong>Djangocon</strong> 
  conference in Portland Oregon in 2009, which provided me with invaluable knowledge that I have been able to apply to my 
  work over the subsequent years.  </p>
<p>Recently I have gone back to developing using <strong>PHP</strong> after many years away. During my  time at Business 
  Link, I cut my teeth as a developer using PHP, and it was PHP that made me passionate about development.  I am currently 
  using modern PHP frameworks in my development, such as <strong>Laravel</strong> and <strong>Codeigniter</strong>, and this 
  has made me really enjoy moving back to PHP.  Even when I was developing using Python I always tried to maintain a good 
  level of knowledge of PHP,  investigating frawmeworks such as <strong>CakePHP</strong> and developing personal projects 
  using PHP.
</p>
<p>As a Developer I try to adhere as much as possible to the <strong>DRY</strong> principle and I always try to make my 
  code as reusable as possible, primarily through the use of <strong>object-orientated</strong> code.  I always ensure that
  my code is appropriately documented, using Sphinx software to publish <strong>documentation</strong>.  As one would expect, 
  I am fully versed in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>XHTML</strong> and have used <strong>HTML5</strong> for delivering 
  video content and in the development of <strong>mobile apps</strong>.  </p>
<p>I ensure that all my sites work on major browsers (from Internet Explorer 7 and above). I am an expert user 
  of <strong>CSS</strong>, and have been responsible for the design elements of a number of websites that I have developed. 
  My Masters degree instilled in me the importance of <strong>usability</strong> in user-interface design. I have read Jakob 
  Nielsen’s work in web usability, and although I sometimes disagree with his ideas I always try to follow the principal that 
  simplicity is best, and firmly believe that usable websites do not have to be uninteresting.</p>
<p>I am an experienced user of <strong>XML</strong>, and in my time at Newcastle was funded to work alongside commercial 
  providers to develop two separate XML specifications, for e-portfolios and for competency frameworks. I have also developed 
    and written applications to consume XML-based web services, using <strong>REST</strong>, <strong>SOAP</strong> 
    and <strong>XML-RPC</strong>. I have used a number of commercially available APIs, both in my professional work and in 
    personal projects, including applications that consume the <strong>APIs</strong> from Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and Last.fm. </p>
<p>I use <strong>Javascript</strong> to enhance the user interfaces of the websites I develop, including using 
  <strong>AJAX</strong> (and <strong>JSON</strong> as the data format) to provide more interactive and intuitive methods of 
  communicating with the database. I am a particular advocate of <strong>JQuery</strong>, but have also used several other 
  Javascript frameworks, including Mootools, Prototype and Scriptaculous.  I have used <strong>JQuery mobile</strong> 
  and <strong>Phonegap</strong> in developing mobile apps.  I am a regular user of <strong>GIT</strong> for version control 
  through <strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/paulh">Bitbucket</a></strong> and <strong>
  <a href="https://github.com/paulhorner79/">GitHub</a></strong>, and have also used both SVN and Mercurial.  </p>
<p>Many years ago, I developed the mapofstrange.com website, which showcased unusual sightings in <strong>Google Maps</strong>. 
  At its peak, this site regularly had more than a million unique visits every month, and was even once featured on 
  German television.</p>
<p>I am experienced in <strong>server administration</strong>, and am a regular user of the <strong>Linux</strong> command line.  
  I have setup Linux and <strong>Windows</strong> servers to deploy websites.  I have designed technical architectures to ensure 
  that systems and software work together.  I understand the importance of ensuring that systems are always available and when
  I worked at Northumbria I developed and deployed a monitoring system, which notified me by email and text message whenever 
  the Northumbria webcasts system was unavailable.</p>
<p>I have been heavily involved in the <strong>filming</strong> and <strong>production</strong> of professional-level 
  <strong>videos</strong>, using technology from the <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong>.  The Law School webcasts system 
  I developed used a combination of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>Flash</strong> to ensure that the maximum number of 
  people could view the videos.  </p>
<p>I am an experienced <strong>database administrator</strong>.  I have used <strong>MySQL</strong> and 
  <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> widely, and used <strong>MSSQL Server</strong> at Northumbria for enterprise-level 
  systems. I have experience of using <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> to consume data from legacy systems alongside 
  the <strong>Django ORM</strong>. And have used Eloquent as a PHP ORM.  My Masters degree taught me good data management 
  techniques, including <strong>database normalisation</strong> techniques and indexing.</p>
