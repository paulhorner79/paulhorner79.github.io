<hr><h2>My Skills</h2>

<p>I have been developing <strong>eLearning</strong> systems since 2005 through my work at Northumbria University and previously at Newcastle University.  I have developed diverse systems ranging including <strong>Virtual Learning Environments</strong>, Video Learning Systems, <strong>ePortfolios</strong> and Student Management Systems.  I have delivered presentations on my work at <strong>Conferences</strong> across the UK and Europe, and have subsequently authored a number of published papers. </p>

<p>I have been using <strong>Python</strong> professionally for many years.  I have extensive experience of <strong>Zope</strong>, and have used <strong>Django</strong> since 2009. I attended the <strong>Djangocon</strong> conference in Portland Oregon in 2009, which provided me with invaluable knowledge that I have been able to apply to my work over the subsequent years.  </p>

<p>As a Developer I try to adhere as much as possible to the <strong>DRY</strong> principle and I always try to make my code as reusable as possible, primarily through the use of <strong>object-orientated</strong> code.  I always ensure that my code is appropriately documented, using Sphinx software to publish <strong>documentation</strong>.  As one would expect, I am fully versed in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>XHTML</strong> and have used <strong>HTML5</strong> for delivering video content and in the development of <strong>mobile apps</strong>.  </p>

<p>I ensure that all my sites work on major browsers (from Internet Explorer 7 and above). I am an expert user of <strong>CSS</strong>, and have been responsible for the design elements of a number of websites that I have developed. My Masters degree instilled in me the importance of <strong>usability</strong> in user-interface design. I have read Jakob Nielsen’s work in web usability, and although I sometimes disagree with his ideas I always try to follow the principal that simplicity is best, and firmly believe that usable websites do not have to be uninteresting.</p>

<p>I am an experienced user of <strong>XML</strong>, and in my time at Newcastle was funded to work alongside commercial providers to develop two separate XML specifications, for e-portfolios and for competency frameworks. I have also developed and written applications to consume XML-based web services, using <strong>REST</strong>, <strong>SOAP</strong> and <strong>XML-RPC</strong>. I have used a number of commercially available APIs, both in my professional work and in personal projects, including applications that consume the <strong>APIs</strong> from Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and Last.fm. </p>

<p>I use <strong>Javascript</strong> to enhance the user interfaces of the websites I develop, including using <strong>AJAX</strong> (and <strong>JSON</strong> as the data format) to provide more interactive and intuitive methods of communicating with the database. I am a particular advocate of <strong>JQuery</strong>, but have also used several other Javascript frameworks, including Mootools, Prototype and Scriptaculous.  I have used <strong>JQuery mobile</strong> and <strong>Phonegap</strong> in developing mobile apps.  I am a regular user of <strong>GIT</strong> for version control through <strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/paulh">Bitbucket</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/paulhorner79/">GitHub</a></strong>, and have also used both SVN and Mercurial.  </p>

<p>In my role at Business Link, I was primarily a <strong>PHP</strong> developer, and I have always tried to maintain a good level of knowledge of PHP.  I have investigated the <strong>CakePHP</strong> and <strong>CodeIgniter</strong> frameworks and developed the mapofstrange.com website, which showcased unusual sightings in <strong>Google Maps</strong>. At its peak, this site regularly had more than a million unique visits every month, and was even once featured on German television. </p>

<p>I am experienced in <strong>server administration</strong>, and am a regular user of the <strong>Linux</strong> command line.  I have setup Linux and <strong>Windows</strong> servers to deploy websites.  I have designed technical architectures to ensure that systems and software work together.  I understand the importance of ensuring that systems are always available and have developed and deployed a monitoring system, which notifies me by email and text message whenever the Northumbria webcasts system is unavailable.</p>

<p>I have been heavily involved in the <strong>filming</strong> and <strong>production</strong> of professional-level <strong>videos</strong>, using technology from the <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong>.  The Law School webcasts system I developed uses a combination of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>Flash</strong> to ensure that the maximum number of people can view the videos.  </p>

<p>I am an experienced <strong>database administrator</strong>.  I have used <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> widely, and use <strong>MSSQL Server</strong> at Northumbria for enterprise-level systems. I have experience of using <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> to consume data from legacy systems alongside the <strong>Django ORM</strong>. My Masters degree taught me good data management techniques, including <strong>database normalisation</strong> techniques and indexing.</p>
